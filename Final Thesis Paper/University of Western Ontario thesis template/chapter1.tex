\section{Background}
The Breast Cancer type 1/2, usually referred as BRCA1/2, are proteins that consists of genes that code for BRCA1 in humans. BRCA1/2 are human tumor suppressor genes, that are responsible for repairing the DNA~\cite{duncan1998brca1}. 
When the mutation exists on these genes may cause the impairments of proper functions, which can lead to the possibility of capturing the breast, ovarian, or other specific cancers \cite{greer2006role, haffty2002outcome, huang2018association}. 
Inheriting one of these mutations does not guarantee developing cancer disease, but the mutation may increase the risk of getting those cancers \cite{friedenson2007brca1}. There are many medical and statistical development in modelling the competing risk
of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, such as applying parametric survival analysis based on two cancer outcomes developed by~\citet{choi2021competing}, and some clinical trials via risk-reducing approach of treatments on breast cancer patients~\cite{choi2021association}.
