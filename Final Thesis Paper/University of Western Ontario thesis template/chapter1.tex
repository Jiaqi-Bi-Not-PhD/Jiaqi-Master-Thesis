\section{Background}
The Breast Cancer type 1/2, usually referred as BRCA1/2, are proteins that consists of genes that code for BRCA1 in humans. BRCA1/2 are human tumor suppressor genes, that are responsible for repairing the DNA~\cite{duncan1998brca1}. 
When the mutation exists on these genes may cause the impairments of proper functions, which can lead to the possibility of capturing the breast, ovarian, or other specific cancers \cite{greer2006role, haffty2002outcome, huang2018association}. 
Inheriting one of these mutations does not guarantee developing cancer disease, but the mutation may increase the risk of getting those cancers \cite{friedenson2007brca1}.
